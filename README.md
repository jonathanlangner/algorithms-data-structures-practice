# algorithms-data-structures-practice
A place to practice algorithms and data structures.



My goal is to go through a variety of Data Structures including:

a. Stacks (Array Stack Done.)
b. Queues
c. Binary Trees
d. Hashing
e. Linked Lists
f. Graphs
g. Heaps
h. Multi-dimensional Arrays. 


After I have gone through and practiced with the Data Structures I will be practicing a variety of Algorithms planned thus far:
a. Recursive Algorithms
b. Sorting Algorithms
c. Sorting Algorithms
d. Hashing Algorithms
e. Divide and Conquer Algorithms

My end goal of all this practice:
Build examples which will use my data structures and algorithm skills and begin implementing them into my daily design projects. 



Additional Objective:
Begin implementing testing into all future JS Projects by using node.js and Jest.
A front end interface is being designed and planned for the app.
