# algorithms-data-structures-practice
A place to practice algorithms and data structures. 

Additionally, I am beginning to add testing for the project, as I want to begin getting in the habit of testing each of my projects.


My goal is to go through a variety of Data Structures including:

a. Stacks (Array Stack Done.)
b. Queues
c. Binary Trees
d. Hashing
e. Linked Lists
f. Graphs
g. Heaps
h. Multi-dimensional Arrays. 


After I have gone through and practiced with the Data Structures I will be practicing a variety of Algorithms planned thus far:
a. Recursive Algorithms
b. Sorting Algorithms
c. Sorting Algorithms
d. Hashing Algorithms
e. Divide and Conquer Algorithms
f. I will add other Algorithms along the way if I find them to valuable or useful to the project.


My end goal of this practice:
Build examples which will use my data structures and algorithm skills and begin implementing them into my daily design projects. 


Additional Objective:
Begin implementing testing into all future JS Projects by using node.js and Jest.
A front end interface is being designed and planned for the app.

## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js installed in your environment.
Additionally, you will need express.js and jest for running and testing the different algorithms and data structures.

### Installing Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer and follow the instructions there.
- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

## Install
    $ git clone https://github.com/jonathanlangner/algorithms-data-structures-practice
    $ cd algorithms-data-structures-practice
    $ npm install

## Running the project

    $ npm test 
    $ node app.mjs
